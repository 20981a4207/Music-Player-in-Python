## About Music Players

Music players are very popular these days because music has become popular. Kids don’t know who the president is, but they do know who Justin Bieber is. Ever guess why is that? It’s because humans respond calmly to music, and good music always cheers you up.

This is why music players like Spotify, Wynk, and Gaana have become popular because they bring music closer to you. Well, in this python music player project, we are going to help you make your own GUI based mp3 music player and have fun while doing it!

## Python Music Player Project

The objective of this project is to create a GUI based python music player from scratch using python. For this project, you will need intermediate knowledge of the Tkinter widgets, basic knowledge about tkinter.filedialog, pygame.mixer, and os libraries.

## Project Prerequisites:

To create this music player python project, you will need intermediate understanding of Python Tkinter, and basic knowledge about the Pygame and ttkwidgets libraries.

Tkinter – To create the GUI for the project.

Pygame.mixer – This is a pygame module that is used to load and play music.
